# Frontend Portfolio project

## Description
This project modifies the html structure to make it more accessible.
This is done by including semantic elements throughout the pages so that it can be more accessible to search engines. It also adds alternative texts to image tags to make them informative even when the images do not render and also make it accessible to divices like braille keyboards.
